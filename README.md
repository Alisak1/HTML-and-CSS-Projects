# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository holds all my HTML and CSS working projects for my course at The Tech Academy.
The following displays the sample websites I have made using HTML and CSS:
Space Station Website Project: An example page using HTML and CSS that illustrates a navbar, image containers and form.
Movie Theater Website Project: An example page using Bootstrap4, components include a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
